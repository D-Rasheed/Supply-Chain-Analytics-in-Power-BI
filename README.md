## Make vs. Buy Analysis in Power BI

### Description:
This repository contains a comprehensive Supply Chain Analytics case study, focusing on building an interactive Make vs. Buy Analysis Tool in Power BI. The project helps organizations optimize procurement decisions by analyzing supplier quotes and internal manufacturing costs.

### Overview
In this case study, we developed an interactive Power BI tool to evaluate and compare Make vs. Buy decisions for a fictional company, Widgetmakers Inc. The tool supports cost analysis, scenario planning, and actionable decision-making in supply chain management.

### Project Objectives
- Analyze supplier quotes and internal manufacturing costs.
- Build dynamic cost calculation tools for different production volumes.
- Visualize cost comparisons between "Make" and "Buy" options.
- Recommend the optimal production volume and procurement strategy.

### Key Features
- Buy Option Cost Analysis: Calculated supplier costs at fixed and variable production volumes.
- Scenario Analysis: Incorporated volume parameters and non-recurring costs into the analysis.
- Make Option Cost Analysis: Assessed internal manufacturing costs, including incremental costs and capacity investments.
- Interactive Dashboards: Visualized insights to support strategic decision-making.

### Data Analysis Steps
#### Chapter 1: Buy Option Full Cost at Fixed Volumes
- Calculated extended and full costs for each supplier.
- Identified the lowest-cost supplier for fixed production volumes.

#### Chapter 2: Buy Option Full Cost at Variable Volumes
- Built a scenario analysis tool for variable production volumes.
- Visualized cost fluctuations across different suppliers.

#### Chapter 3: Make Option Full Cost and Cost Avoidance
- Analyzed internal manufacturing costs, factoring in capital investments and quality costs.
- Compared "Make vs. Buy" options to identify cost-saving opportunities.

### Dashboards
The Power BI dashboards feature:

- Supplier cost comparisons for different volumes.
- Scenario planner for cost variations based on volume changes.
- Cost avoidance insights for optimal decision-making.

### Conclusion
This project showcases how Power BI transforms supply chain analytics by offering scalability, interactivity, and actionable insights. Explore the repository for the dataset, PBIX files, and step-by-step project details.
